Files can be served as templates.
Files are assumed to be UTF-8 text.

What files are considered templates can be specified by the per disc folder using the Templates array (array of string templates).
Patterns can use wildcards '*' (matches one or more) or '?' (matches one).
If the pattern starts with '$' the rest of the pattern is a regular expression.
If the pattern starts with '#' the match should be case insensitive.
If the pattern starts with '$#' the rest of the pattern is a regular expression matched case insensitive.

Variables are of the format ${VarName}.
Variable names are case sensitive.
Templates can be deemed as dynamic or static depending on what variables they use.
Dynamic templates is not cached (client or server side) while static will be cached according to the folders cache policies.
Other things like runtime compression / auth will be handled like any file.


Variable values can be transformed by prepending the variable name with one of the following.
Examples for a variable value of "Hello world! & have FUN!".
_ = Make lower case, ex: ${_VarName} will result in "hello world! & have fun!".
^ = Make upper case, ex: ${^VarName} will result in "HELLO WORLD! & HAVE FUN!".
@ = Make html attribute safe (HttpUtility.HtmlAttributeEncode), ex: ${@VarName} will result in "Hello world! \&amp; have FUN!".
# = Make html value safe (HttpUtility.HtmlEncode), ex: ${#VarName} will result in "Hello world! \&amp; have FUN!".
% = Make URL safe (HttpUtility.UrlEncode), ex: ${%VarName} will result in "Hello+world!+%26+have+FUN!".
$ = Make javascript string safe (HttpUtility.JavaScriptStringEncode), ex: ${$VarName} will result in "Hello world! \\u0026 have FUN!".
Only one of _ and ^ may be used.
Only one of @, #, % and $ may be used.
_ or ^ can be combined with one of @, #, % and $, ex: _#, ^$

You set variables by using the query paramaters, ex: "xyz/Welcome.html?Name=John Doe&Mail=John.Doe@gmail.com":
${Name} in Welcome.html will now be replaced with "John Doe".
${Mail} in Welcome.html will now be replaced with "John.Doe@gmail.com".

There are some built in variables:
Env.* will expose all system environment variables.
EnvInfo.* exposes some misc system/app values.
Session.* exposes some session variables.
Server.* exposes some server variables.

The current value of the built in variables can be found in the TemplateVariables table.
