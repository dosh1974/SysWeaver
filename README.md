# OVERVIEW

A framework for building services in .NET on Linux and Windows.  
Focus is on building robust primitives for large systems.  
Functionality is centered around a web server and an easy way to add API's.  


Functionality of a specific service is configured in a single json file that declares what micro-services to use and their parameters.
